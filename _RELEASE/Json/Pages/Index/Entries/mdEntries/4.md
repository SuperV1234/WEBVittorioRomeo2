Hello everyone, hope you had great holidays!

I've finished part **3** and **4** of my C++11 tutorial series, **Dive into C++11**.

[They're available on YouTube.](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTEcWGdSiQenl4YRPvSqW7UPC6SiGNN7e)

Part 3 talks about C++ *variable lifetime* and *manual memory management*. Part 4 explains what *smart pointers* are and how to use them.

I've also uploaded a new [operation bloodshed devlog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO86YBYIgqY).

Hope you find the videos interesting! 

*(I've also added links to the Open Hexagon 2.0 release candidate in the downloads page. 1.92 servers were shut down so that version may have issues starting as the IP address does not exist anymore. 2.0 RC1 should be playable.)*
