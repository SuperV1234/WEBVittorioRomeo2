Happy new year everyone! Hope you enjoyed your holiday.

A new tutorial video is available on my channel:

[Handle-based entity management experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KSlhppzNE&list=UU1XihgHdkNOQd5IBHnIZWbA)

In this video I experiment with **entity management** and **storage**. 
I show a smart-pointer cache-unfriendly approach and a more efficient (yet harder to implement) **handle-based cache friendly approach**. 

Hope you find it interesting!ï»¿
