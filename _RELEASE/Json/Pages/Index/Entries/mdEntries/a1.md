I've uploaded part **5** of *Dive into C++11* on my YouTube channel.

[You can watch the video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAmtgvwHInM)

In this episode we'll see various ways of implementing entity management in your games, starting with a very simple "one vector per object type" approach. We'll consider a "polymorphic inheritance tree" approach as well, and finish the video by re-implementing our Arkanoid clone with a simple but effective component-based design.

The goal of the episode is showing the thought process behind the design and improvement of an entity management system.

**Enjoy!**
