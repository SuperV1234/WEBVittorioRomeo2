Hello!

[I've recently uploaded a video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtOroHie2d8) to give everyone some updates about my projects and share my new experiences.

To put it briefly, I've had a very busy summer and couldn't find much time to work on my main projects such as **Open Hexagon** or **Operation Bloodshed**. 
Many minor updates to them and to my libraries were however released.

In september I've also spoke at [**CppCon 2014**](http://cppcon.org/) in Bellevue about game development with C++11/C++14. 
It was an amazing experience! 

[The slides are already available](https://github.com/SuperV1234/cppcon2014), the video of the talk should be released soon by the CppCon staff, along with an interview by Channel 9.

That's it! 

I hope I'll be able to find more time to work on my projects and finally release **OH2.0**.
