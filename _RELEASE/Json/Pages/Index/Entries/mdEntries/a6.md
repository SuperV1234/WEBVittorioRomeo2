I'm back from [C++Now 2016](http://cppnow.org/), where I participated as a speaker and as a student/volunteer.

I've written [**a brief trip report**](https://github.com/SuperV1234/cppnow2016/blob/master/trip_report.md). I had a fantastic time at the conference and wanted to talk about my experience.

The report is mostly focused on my favorite code snippets/techniques shown during the talks and on my sessions *(and the feedback I've received on them)*.

Enjoy!
