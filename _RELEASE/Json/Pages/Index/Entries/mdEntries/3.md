I've been working on a new project lately, [operation bloodshed](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=36131.0), an attempt at the creation of a spiritual successor to [Operation Carnage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0h_UgX7oYM), one of my favorite childhood games.

[Operation Carnage](http://www.midnightsynergy.com/ancient.htm) is a 1996 abandonware arcade game with a very simple but addicting and fun gameplay. It has a very interesting shooting/strafing mechanic that is easy to learn but hard to master. 
Unfortunately, it also has some design flaws that I'll try to solve in my game.

The gameplay is very fast-paced, a typical feature of overhead retro-shooters. I worked on persistent blood particle effects and used my [custom pseudo-physics engine, SSVSCollision](https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVSCollision), to deal with collisions and enemy movement. It works quite well so far.

[operation bloodshed](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=36131.0) is **very** work-in-progress, but I've recorded some video devlogs [that you can watch on my youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperVictorius).

Here is [devlog #13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIcEywsZ5eE) showing some gameplay! 

The project will be **free**, **open-source** and **crossplatform**.

I'm also trying to maintain an updated devlog [here on TIGSource](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=36131.0).
