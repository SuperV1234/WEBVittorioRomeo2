I added [discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) to [my static website generator](https://github.com/SuperV1234/WEBVittorioRomeo2).

Writing blog posts is now **much easier**!

###ffmpeg, twitch.tv

I've also started *occasionally* streaming myself code on [twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv). It was painful to set up, but these are the commands I use:

* Setting up loopbacks to record both microphone and pc audio
	
		#!/bin/bash
		pactl load-module module-null-sink
		pactl load-module module-loopback
		pactl load-module module-loopback

* Launching the stream itself

		#!/bin/bash
		KEY="<your twitch.tv key here>"
		ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -r 20 -i :0.0+1680,0 -f alsa -ac 2 -i pulse -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1920x1080 -threads 4 -acodec libmp3lame -ar 22050 -qscale 3 -b 712000 -bufsize 512k -af aresample=44100 -f flv "rtmp://live-ams.twitch.tv/app/$KEY"

###school finals results

After the last blog post my exam score was announced: I graduated with **100/100 cum laude**!

This is a great achievement for me. I am already looking forward to start *computer science* in university in a few months.
