I've finally participated in [Ludum Dare 27, a 48 hour game-development competition](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=26255).

My game is [10corp, a reflex-based, frustrating, puzzle platformer](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=26255).

The game is written in C++11, using only SFML2.1 and JsonCpp as external dependencies. 
It is written using my personal "SSV framework", written from scratch, which is free, open-source and available on GitHub. 

I couldn't manage to polish the game as much as I wanted to. There only are 7 playable levels, no gfx options, no key rebinding, et cetera. 

Still, being my first Ludum Dare, it was a very interesting and learning experience and I'm glad (and surprised) I managed to create something (in my opinion) worth playing that could become a fun little game with additional polish. 

Hope you enjoy my entry!

Also, Open Hexagon news:

* 2.0 is still under development, don't worry! It will take some time, though.
