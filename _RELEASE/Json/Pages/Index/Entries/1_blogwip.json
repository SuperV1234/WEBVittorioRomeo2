				"Text": "<p>In the latest months I've been mostly working on my libraries that you can find on GitHub.</br>
						I've \"reinvented\" the wheel by creating my own cross-platform filesystem and my own template system (similar to CTemplate). You can find both of them in SSVUtils, on my GitHub page. Pull requests and comments are greatly appreciated!</br>
						I am happy to announce that the newest version of this website is generated using those libraries, without any Boost or CTemplate dependency.</p>
						<p>Other news: real life is taking a lot of time away from programming. I will have my finals this month, and then I'll get into computer science education as soon as possible.</p>
						<p>I've also added a donation button to the website: since I'm currently unemployed every donation would be really helpful, especially in paying the server. Consider donating if you like my work :)</p>
						<p>Hopefully I'll find the time to make some new tutorials/youtube videos before my finals. Stay tuned!</p>
